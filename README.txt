No bugs that I can think of or have experienced.

I didn't provide a quit button because you can just refresh your browser or exit out with the browers/OS user interface.

I couldn't really figure out how to implement the number of steps and number of angular positions buttons, but I think the variable steps in my program does the right thing if you change that before you run the program. It is initially 16.

Couldn't quite figure out how to implement the dotted lines in between the control points so I just used a yellow line instead. bezier curves are blue and the axis of rotation is gray.
